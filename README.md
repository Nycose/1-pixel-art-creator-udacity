# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Overview
A introductory project in a Udacity programming bootcamp co-created by Google and Facebook. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. 

A summary of the project specification/rubric is listed below but the app actually has a few additional features.

### Project Specification & Summary
* The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size.
* Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.
* The user can color the pixels in the grid.
* Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.
* Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).
* The user can reset the grid to a blank state.
* If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.
